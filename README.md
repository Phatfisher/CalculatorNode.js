# CalculatorNode.js
Creating a addition calculator with node.js, express, and javascript. Was mainly intended to get familiar with using nodejs,
express, and javascript. Also included a bmi example(Doesn't actally calculate bmi) to practice setting up something similar to 
calculator. 

I do plan on coming back in and fleshing out more code and use css and html to create a nicer looking calculator.
